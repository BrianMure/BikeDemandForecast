## Bike Demand Forecasting

### Project Overview

- This project aims to predict the demand for bike rentals based on various factors such as time, weather, and seasonality. Using a machine learning model, the project seeks to accurately forecast the number of bikes that will be rented in different conditions, helping bike rental companies optimize their inventory and improve customer satisfaction.

### Project Structure

1. Dataset/: Contains the training and testing datasets.
2. Notebooks/: Includes the Jupyter notebook with all the code for data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
3. README.md: This file provides an overview and instructions for the project.
4. requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.

### Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

- id: Unique identifier for each record.
- year: Year of the data.
- hour: Hour of the day (0-23).
- season: Season of the year (1: Winter, 2: Spring, 3: Summer, 4: Fall).
- holiday: Whether the day is a holiday (1: Yes, 0: No).
- workingday: Whether the day is a working day (1: Yes, 0: No).
- weather: Weather conditions (1: Clear, 2: Mist, 3: Light Snow/Rain, 4: Heavy Rain/Snow).
- temp: Actual temperature in Celsius.
- atemp: Feels-like temperature in Celsius.
- humidity: Relative humidity in percentage.
- windspeed: Wind speed in km/h.
- count: Number of bikes rented (target variable).

### Project Goals

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data to understand relationships and patterns.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
- Model Building: Train machine learning models to predict bike rental demand.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Forecasting: Predict future bike rental demand based on the best-performing model
